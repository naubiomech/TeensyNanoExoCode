"baseline start" = start of quiet standing baseline metabolic measurement
"baseline end" = end of quiet standing baseline metabolic measurement

"exo1_start" = start of timed walking, once treadmill was up to speed
"exo1_end" = end of timed walking, once eight minutes had elapsed.

"#Min" = is the number of minutes since the start data marker, rounded to the nearest available data point
[Do to inconsitent sampling of the device there was not always a data point availabe at the #Min exactly]

In Shod_Metabolic, you will notice that it says "exo1_start" and "exo1_end". 
While labeled this way, the participant did NOT walk with the exo in this condition.
These labels were maintained despite being misrepresntative to make using the processing code as easy as possible to run without having to change it.
[With hindsight it would have been better to use generic terminology like "start" and "end" in the processing code]
