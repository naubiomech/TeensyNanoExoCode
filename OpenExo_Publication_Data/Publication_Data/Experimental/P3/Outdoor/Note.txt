"Outdoor_Results" contains the recorded values (and subsequently calculated values) from the test.

While no metabolic results were presented in the text, we did collect metabolic data which is included here.
These data were not presented in the paper as they were not collected in a way that facilitated a comparison between conditions. 
This includes unstandardized speeds/durations of the task and the fact that no data was recorded for a few minutes after the collection 
to account for the metabolic delay. Data and a modified code to assess it are included for full transparency.
