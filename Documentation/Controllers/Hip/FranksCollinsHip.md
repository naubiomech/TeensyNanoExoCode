# Franks Collins Hip Controller

## Description
Provides Hip assistance based on a series of splines that have an extension and flexion portion.
Uses percent gait, requiring heel FSR.

## Parameters
Parameter index order can be found in [ControllerData.h](/ExoCode/src/ControllerData.h).
- mass - User mass in kg used for denormalizing torque.
- trough_normalized_torque_Nm_kg - Largest extension torque normalized to user mass (Nm/kg).
- peak_normalized_torque_Nm_kg - Largest flexion torque normalized to user mass (Nm/kg).
- start_percent_gait - Percent gait to start the torque pattern so it doesn't have a discontinuity at heel strike.
- trough_onset_percent_gait - Percent gait to start applying extension torque.
- trough_percent_gait - Percent gait to apply the largest extension torque.
- mid_time - Transition point between extension and flexion to apply 0 torque.
- mid_duration - The duration of the transition pause as a percent of the gait cycle.
- peak_percent_gait - Percent gait to apply the largest flexion torque.
- peak_offset_percent_gait - Percent gait to stop applying flexion torque.
- use_pid - This flag turns PID on(1) or off(0)
- p_gain - Proportional gain for closed loop controls
- i_gain - Integral gain for closed loop controls
- d_gain - Derivative gain for closed loop controls
