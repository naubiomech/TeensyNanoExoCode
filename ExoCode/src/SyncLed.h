/**
 * @file SyncLed.h
 *
 * @brief Class to blink and LED in a specific pattern to syncronize the data from the microcontroler with optical tracking systems
 * There will be  _numStartStopBlinks high pulses at the begining and end of the sequence with each pulse lasting _sync_start_stop_half_period_us.
 * In in between the start and stop it will blink with each high or low lasting _sync_half_period_us.
 * The sequence is started and stopped using trigger().
 * 
 * This setup requires an external timer since the arduino ISR timers can't take in arguments like the class's self.
 * The to change the LED's actual on/off state, updateLed must be called.
 * A sample wrapper for the ISR for the timer:
 * 
 *  void grossLedInteruptWrapper(void)
 *  {
 *    syncLed.syncLedHandler(); // calculate the LED state based on the timer, but don't change the actual LED state.
 *    syncTimer.begin(grossLedInteruptWrapper, syncLed.currentSyncPeriod);  // update the timer period ideally we would only do this if it changed, might add a flag to syncLed if needed
 *  }
 * 
 * Then in the main loop or when you are recording data:
 *  int ledState = syncLed.updateLed();  // actually change the led state, and record the state in the data
 *  
 * The static state (not flashing) can be set to either HIGH or LOW
 * 
 * If you need the pin low to be LED on (like with a P channel mosfet) you can change that in the defines below.
